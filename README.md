## Project Overview

In this Jupyter Notebook project, we aim to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches using a Random Forest Classifier. The main steps of the project include:

- Web scraping data from the FBref website using Beautiful Soup.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to create a structured dataset.
- Feature engineering to include relevant factors such as previous match outcomes, goals scored, and home advantage.
- Model training using a Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluating the model's performance and making predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
      git clone https://github.com/Yukesh0409/Predicting-Premier-League-Match-Outcomes

2. Navigate to the project directory:
      cd Premier_League


## Usage

1. Open the `scrap.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Then open the `predict.ipynb` notebook to predict the outcome
3. Execute the prpgram step-by-step within the notebook to run the project and reproduce the results.

## Data Collection

We scraped historical Premier League match data from the FBref website using the Beautiful Soup library. The data includes information about match outcomes, goals scored, home and away teams, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw data from FBref was processed and cleaned within the Jupyter Notebook to create a structured dataset. Data preprocessing steps included:

- Handling missing values.
- Feature extraction and engineering.
- Data transformation and normalization.

## Model Training

We used a Random Forest Classifier to train the predictive model within the Jupyter Notebook. The model takes into account factors such as previous match outcomes, goals scored, and home advantage to predict match outcomes.

## Results and Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision. The evaluation results are presented and discussed within the notebook.

## Future Enhancements

This Jupyter Notebook project serves as a starting point, and there are several avenues for future enhancements, such as:

- Incorporating additional features like player statistics, team form, and weather conditions.
- Trying out different machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Developing a web application for real-time match outcome predictions.
